Goal: I plan to create a model that is able to identify the artist behind various famous artworks. This project is intended to be a first step
in the process of eventually learning to train models to evaluate artwork and identify forgery (similar to the work done by https://art-recognition.com/)

Data: 
- https://www.kaggle.com/ikarus777/best-artworks-of-all-time
- This dataset has images of artworks by various artists. There is also a csv with more information about the artists (their style/genre, their names, nationality, etc)
- I plan to work with the images and the names of the artists. If I have time, I may work with the style as well
EDIT: I switched to the following dataset of impressionist paintings: https://www.kaggle.com/delayedkarma/impressionist-classifier-data
- the data is separated into training and validation folders
- there are ten folders for each class within the training and validation folders, and there are ~400 images corresponding to each class

Tools/Algorithms:
- I expect to use a CNN for this project, probably wih keras?...I'm not sure exactly what else beyond that at this point

MVP Goal:
- I think an MVP would be a baseline model that can identify *something* from the painting images
